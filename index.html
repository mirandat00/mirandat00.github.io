								<b>Who rises to the top?</b><br>Broadly, my research is focused on investigating who rises to status and influence within groups, why, and under which conditions. Specifically, I am interested in how people can harness prosocial actions to gain and maintain status and influence, and when those strategies are most most successful. My current research is centered around identifying how expressions of humility impact perceptions of status among peers and followers. The ultimate objectives for my research are to better understand the challenges people of diverse backgrounds face in rising to top positions and provide insight on cultivating ethical and responsible pathways to leadership.
